abstract = {Urban planners face significant challenges when identifying building energy efficiency opportunities and developing strategies to achieve efficient and sustainable urban environments. A possible scalable solution to tackle this problem is through the analysis of building stock databases. Such databases can support and assist with building energy benchmarking and potential retrofit performance analysis. However, developing a building stock database is a time-intensive modeling procedure that requires extensive data (both geometric and non-geometric). Furthermore, the available data for developing a building database is sparse, inconsistent, diverse and heterogeneous in nature. The main aim of this study is to develop a generic methodology to optimize urban scale energy retrofit decisions for residential buildings using data-driven approaches. Furthermore, data-driven approaches identify the key features influencing building energy performance. The proposed methodology formulates retrofit solutions and identifies optimal features for the residential building stock of Dublin. Results signify the importance of data-driven retrofit modeling as the feature selection process reduces the number of features in Dublin's building stock database from 203 to 56 with a building rating prediction accuracy of 86{\%}. Amongst the 56 features, 16 are identified to be recommended as retrofit measures (such as fabric renovation values and heating system upgrade features) associated with each energy-efficiency rating. Urban planners and energy policymakers could use this methodology to optimize large-scale retrofit implementation, particularly at an urban scale with limited resources. Furthermore, stakeholders at the local authority level can estimate the required retrofit investment costs, emission reductions and energy savings using the target retrofit features of energy-efficiency ratings.},

This article describes design, input data and current usage of TIMES-DK, the first Danish energy system model that includes the complete national energy system, covering long-term technology investments. The article aims at explaining the modelling approach; highlighting strengths and reflecting upon limitations of the model; illustrating possible applications of TIMES-DK and inspiring new model developments. Some of the key strengths of the model include simultaneous optimisation of operation and investments across the complete energy system over the whole modelling horizon, explicit representation of the most important sectors of the economy, modular structure and the possibility of linking to a computable general equilibrium model for an additional insight on, e.g. public finance or CO2-leakage. TIMES-DK is being developed in close collaboration between an energy agency, a university and a consulting firm, to improve its robustness, relevance and impact on policy making. It allows for a wide range of applications including exploratory energy scenarios and policy analysis. To meet challenges of the future, further development of the model is needed and consequently the article provides references to ongoing projects addressing current development needs, such as improved representation of transport and flexible handling of the temporal dimension. To support a democratic and transparent process around decisions for the future Danish energy system, TIMES-DK should become available to interested parties.},

abstract = {Agriculture is responsible for approximately 25{\%} of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This significant share highlights the fundamental importance of the agricultural sector in the global GHG emissions reduction challenge. This article develops and tests a methodology for the integration of agricultural and energy systems modelling. The goal of the research is to extend an energy systems modelling approach to agriculture in order to provide richer insights into the dynamics and interactions between the two (e.g. in competition for land-use). We build Agri-TIMES, an agricultural systems module using the TIMES energy systems modelling framework, to model the effect of livestock emissions and explore emissions reduction options. The research focuses on Ireland, which is an interesting test case for two reasons: first, agriculture currently accounts for about 30{\%} of Ireland's GHG emissions, significantly higher than other industrialized countries yet comparable with global levels (here including emissions associated with other land-use change and forestation); second, Ireland is both a complete and reasonably sized agricultural system to act as a test case for this new approach. This article describes the methodology used, the data requirements, and technical assumptions made to facilitate the modelling. It also presents results to illustrate the approach and provide associated initial insights. Policy relevance Most of the policy focus with regard to climate mitigation targets has been on reducing energy-related CO2 emissions, which is understandable as they represent by far the largest source of emissions. Non-energy-related GHG emissions – largely from agriculture, industrial processes, and waste – have received significantly less attention in policy discourse. Going forward, however, if significant cuts are made in energy-related CO2 emissions, the role of non-energy-related GHG emissions will grow in importance. It is therefore crucial that climate mitigation analyses and strategies are not limited to the energy system. This article shows the value of using integrated energy and agriculture techno-economic modelling techniques to draw evidence for new comprehensive climate policy strategies able to discern between the full range of technical solutions available. It enables the production of economy-wide least-cost climate mitigation pathways.},

The European Union has set ambitious GHG targets for the year 2050 (80-95{\%} below 1990 levels), with each Member State developing strategies to contribute to these targets. This paper focuses on mitigation targets for one Member State, Ireland, an interesting case study due to the growth in GHG emissions (24{\%} increase between 1990 and 2005) and the high share of emissions from agriculture (30{\%} of total GHG emissions). We use the Irish TIMES energy systems modelling tool to build a number of scenarios delivering an 80{\%} emissions reduction target by 2050, including accounting for the limited options for agriculture GHG abatement by increasing the emissions reduction target for the energy system. We then compare the scenario results in terms of changes in energy technology, the role of energy efficiency and renewable energy. We also quantify the economic impacts of the mitigation scenarios in terms of marginal CO2 abatement costs and energy system costs. The paper also sheds light on the impacts of short term targets and policies on long term mitigation pathways. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is anticipated that the decarbonisation of the entire energy system will require the introduction of large shares of variable renewable electricity generation into the power system. Long term integrated energy systems models are useful in improving our understanding of decarbonisation but they struggle to take account of short term variations in the power system associated with increased variable renewable energy penetration. This can oversimplify the ability of power systems to accommodate variable renewables and result in mistaken signals regarding the levels of flexibility required in power systems. Capturing power system impacts of variability within integrated energy system models is challenging due to temporal and technical simplifying assumptions needed to make such models computationally manageable. This paper addresses a gap in the literature by reviewing prominent methodologies that have been applied to address this challenge and the advantages {\&} limitations of each. The methods include soft linking between integrated energy systems models and power systems models and improving the temporal and technical representation of power systems within integrated energy systems models. Each methodology covered approaches the integration of short term variations and assesses the flexibility of the system differently. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of these different methodologies are analysed. This review allows users of integrated energy systems models to select a methodology (or combination of methodologies) to suit their needs. In addition, the analysis identifies remaining gaps and shortcomings.},

abstract = {The greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from land-use change are of particular concern for land-based biofuels. Emissions avoided by substituting fossil fuels with biofuels may be offset by emissions from direct and indirect land-use changes (LUC). There is an urgent need to investigate what impact land-use change emissions may have on the expansion of bioenergy and biofuels, in the context of EU mitigation policies. This paper focuses on Ireland, which faces a number of challenges in delivering its renewable energy and GHG reduction targets. The Irish TIMES energy systems model was used to assess the impact of a range of land-use change emissions' levels on the evolution of Ireland's low-carbon energy system. A reference scenario was developed where LUC is ignored and Ireland achieves a least-cost low-carbon energy system by 2050. If high indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions are included, this results in a decrease by 30 {\%} in bioenergy and a 68 {\%} increase in marginal abatement costs by 2050. Hydrogen is used instead of bioenergy in the freight sector in this scenario, while private cars are fuelled by renewable electricity. If GHG emissions from ILUC were considered less severe, indigenous grass biomethane becomes the key biofuel representing 31 {\%} of total bioenergy consumption. This is in line with recent research in Ireland of the key role that grass biomethane can play.},

The model takes account of the lifetime survival profile of different car types, the trends in vehicle activity over the fleet and the fuel price and income elasticities of new car sales and total fleet activity. The impacts of many policy alternatives may only be simulated by such a bottom-up approach, which can aid policy development and evaluation. The level of detail achieved provides specific insights into the technological drivers of energy consumption, thus aiding planning for meeting climate targets.

abstract = {Radical changes to current national energy systems-including energy efficiency and the decarbonization of electricity-will be required in order to meet challenging carbon emission reduction commitments. Technology explicit energy system optimization models (ESOMs) are widely used to define and assess such low-carbon pathways, but these models only account for the emissions associated with energy combustion and either do not account for or do not correctly allocate emissions arising from infrastructure, manufacturing, construction and transport associated with energy technologies and fuels. This paper addresses this shortcoming, through a hybrid approach that estimates the upstream CO2 emissions across current and future energy technologies for the UK using a multiregional environmentally extended input-output model, and explicitly models the direct and indirect CO2 emissions of energy supply and infrastructure technologies within a national ESOM (the UK TIMES model). Results indicate the large significance of nondomestic indirect emissions, particularly coming from fossil fuel imports, and finds that the marginal abatement cost of mitigating all emissions associated with UK energy supply is roughly double that of mitigating only direct emissions in 2050.

abstract = {In this paper we present a soft-linking methodology that employs detailed simulation outputs from a dedicated power systems model to gain insights and understanding of the generation electricity plant portfolio results for the electricity sector from a separate energy systems model. We apply the methodology and present and discuss the results. The motivation for this soft-linking is to provide a transfer of information from the power systems model strong points to the energy systems model and use this information to improve and develop understanding of energy systems model results. Part of this motivation is derived from a view that one specific energy modeling tool cannot address all aspects of the full energy system in great detail and greater insights and progress can be gained by drawing on the strengths of multiple modeling tools rather than trying to incorporate them all into one comprehensive model. The methodology takes an optimized generation portfolio for a specific year from an energy systems model and undertakes a detailed high resolution chronological simulation of the same portfolio in the power systems model with added degrees of technical detail. Results presented here show that in the absence of key technical constraints, an energy systems model can potentially undervalue flexible resources, underestimate wind curtailment and overestimate the use of baseload plant. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using ESOMs to produce policy-relevant insight requires significant modeler judgement, yet little formal guidance exists on how to conduct analysis with ESOMs. To address this shortcoming, we draw on our collective modelling experience and conduct an extensive literature review to formalize best practice for energy system optimization modelling. We begin by articulating a set of overarching principles that can be used to guide ESOM-based analysis. To help operationalize the guiding principles, we outline and explain critical steps in the modelling process, including how to formulate research questions, set spatio-temporal boundaries, consider appropriate model features, conduct and refine the analysis, quantify uncertainty, and communicate insights. We highlight the need to develop and refine formal guidance on ESOM application, which comes at a critical time as ESOMs are being used to inform national climate targets.},

It takes advantage of a newly available, rich dataset on the construction characteristics of the 2011 housing stock in Ireland. The methodological innovation centres on the use of wall construction type in the modelling and analysis. While Ireland is the focus, this approach is applicable to any EU member state for which data on dwelling characteristics exists from surveys carried as part of Energy Performance Certificate calculations. The model is calibrated to the national energy balance for 2011 by varying the internal temperature assumptions. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the effects of internal temperature and rebound. The paper also highlights some limitations posed by data availability on the accuracy and sophistication of models that can currently be developed, specifically in the Irish case.},

abstract = {This document brings together a wide range of factors which can influence the evolution of the electricity sector into a set of four discrete scenarios. The electricity industry is in a period of rapid change. In the last decade, we have seen the wide-scale integration of renewables into our grid, the emergence and rapid growth of the demand side management sector and the development of ever more sophisticated electricity markets. Further change is coming to the electricity industry. This will be driven by increasing consumer engagement and the emergence of potential industry changing technologies. Preparing for, and responding to, this change is the big challenge for the electricity industry. To prepare for and manage this change, we are introducing scenario planning into how we plan the electricity transmission grid of tomorrow. At the very heart of this approach is engagement with our stakeholders. We received a strong response to our nine week consultation on our draft scenarios earlier this year from both the industry and our public stakeholders. We believe the feedback we received has improved the final document in a number of ways – both in adding new substantial analysis elements and in providing clarity in a number of areas. Our scenarios show that electricity demand will likely increase significantly in the future, largely due to new data centres connecting, but also due to the electrification of the heating and transport sectors over time. Similarly, the electricity generation portfolio will continue to decarbonise, with increasing levels of renewables connecting to the system. The possible ranges for these changes are explored across our four scenarios. The path forward for the energy sector in Ireland has a lot of uncertainty – scenario planning helps us navigate this time of change. However I believe that by taking a proactive and collaborative approach in the coming years we can continue to deliver secure, sustainable power to our customers.},

abstract = {The selection of the social discount rate and the consideration of hurdle rates in energy systems optimisation models affect the creation of sound and comprehensive scenarios useful for energy modellers. Due to the lack of studies about the use of different discounting options in energy optimisation models, the goal of this paper is to fill that gap by establishing the foundations for a debate among energy modellers, policy-makers and stakeholders in this regard. So firstly, we introduced the concept of discount rates both social and technology-specific including a thorough literature review concerning figures, scopes and approaches. Secondly, two models, ETSAP-TIAM and TIMES-Norway, were used to assess the behaviour of the energy systems at different regionalisation levels, Europe and Norway respectively. Thirdly, we analysed the evolution of the electricity production mixes and system costs for both models and considering several values for the discount rates. Finally, results showed that the energy system is strongly affected by changes in the social discount rate. The lower the social discount rate is, the higher the renewable contribution. The social discounting exerts influence on capital intensive investments so it is quite important to look at the energy carriers pathways (fossil-renewable transition). This is what happens in the case of ETSAP-TIAM for Europe. Reversely, in the case of TIMES-Norway, as the electricity system is almost 100{\%} renewable, it is important to take into account the hurdle rates of the technologies to enrich the competition by including their particular risks and barriers. In summary, we recommend using a value not higher than 4-5{\%} for the social discount rate for the European countries as well as to include an exhaustive portfolio of hurdle rates for all the technologies included in the energy optimisation model.},

abstract = {The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) brings formidable challenges in the operation of power system. Long-term energy system planning models overlook the impact of renewable intermittency on system operations due to the computational burden associated with large model size and long planning horizon. Hence, strategies such as soft-linking multiple models are developed, but they do not assure the convergence and optimality of such incoherent modeling framework. In this context, this paper utilizes unit commitment (UC) extension of TIMES modeling framework to integrate operational constraints directly in a long-term power system planning model. This strategy eliminates the complexity of handling multiple models. Results indicate that incorporation of UC constraints improve the performance of conventional generators in terms of increased capacity utilization, and help to assess flexibility requirements with high RESs. Energy storage provides the balancing and flexibility needs with stringent generator constraints. Sensitivity analysis shows that improved flexibility of thermal generators enables increased renewable penetrations.},

abstract = {The Paris Agreement is the last hope to keep global temperature rise below 2°C. The consensus agrees to holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5°C. Each Party's successive nationally determined contribution (NDC) will represent a progression beyond the party's then current NDC, and reflect its highest possible ambition. Using Ireland as a test case, we show that increased mitigation ambition is required to meet the Paris Agreement goals in contrast to current EU policy goals of an 80–95{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} reduction by 2050. For the 1.5°C consistent carbon budgets, the technically feasible scenarios' abatement costs rise to greater than €8,100/tCO2 by 2050. The greatest economic impact is in the short term. Annual GDP growth rates in the period to 2020 reduce from 4{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} to 2.2{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} in the 1.5°C scenario. While aiming for net zero emissions beyond 2050, investment decisions in the next 5–10 years are critical to prevent carbon lock-in. Key policy insights Economic growth can be maintained in Ireland while rapidly decarbonizing the energy system. The social cost of carbon needs to be included as standard in valuation of infrastructure investment planning, both by government finance departments and private investors. Technological feasibility is not the limiting factor in achieving rapid deep decarbonization. Immediate increased decarbonization ambition over the next 3–5 years is critical to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, acknowledging the current 80–95{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} reduction target is not consistent with temperature goals of ‘well below' 2°C and pursuing 1.5°C. Applying carbon budgets to the energy system results in non-linear CO2 emissions reductions over time, which contrast with current EU policy targets, and the implied optimal climate policy and mitigation investment strategy.},

abstract = {Ireland stands on the cusp of great change. In the next twenty years we will grow by an extra one million people. This raises a series of important questions for our consideration, the most basic being where will all these people live and work, what kind of quality of life will we each enjoy, and how will a country of almost six million people impact on our communities and on our built and natural environment? We have a responsibility to answer these questions; we have a responsibility to plan for the changes that we face – to manage our future growth in a planned, productive and sustainable way. This is a challenge certainly, but it is also a great opportunity for a new generation to imagine, and implement, a shared vision for each community on this island. We have made mistakes in the past and we have allowed the country to sprawl and develop without a coherent plan, and to the detriment of many of our places and our people. After nearly a decade since the financial crisis took hold, some parts of our country are now thriving once again, while others continue to face difficulties. Indeed, many communities faced difficulties long before the recent crisis, precisely because there was no shared vision, there was no plan. Project Ireland 2040 represents an important shift from previous approaches to long-term planning and investment by Government. It is an approach that joins up ambition for improvement across the different areas of our lives, bringing the various government departments, agencies, State owned enterprises and local authorities together behind a shared set of strategic objectives for rural, regional and urban development. This document, the National Planning Framework, is a planning framework to guide development and investment over the coming years. It does not provide every detail for every part of the country; rather it empowers each region to lead in the planning and development of their communities, containing a set of national objectives and key principles from which more detailed and refined plans will follow. The companion to this document is the National Development Plan, a ten year strategy for public capital investment of almost €116 Billion. Their joint publication as Project Ireland 2040 is perhaps the most radical break with the past: aligning our investment strategy with our strategic planning documents to, for the first time in the history of our State, create a unified and coherent plan for the country. We began this journey more than three years ago, and through thousands of submissions from members of the public, and dozens of events and consultation exercises right across the country, we have shaped a shared set of strategic objectives to secure the future prosperity of our country, our regions and our people. We are therefore delighted to publish the National Planning Framework as both a vision and a credible development strategy to shape our national, regional and local spatial development in economic, environmental and social terms to 2040.

abstract = {Despite regulation efforts, CO2 emissions from European road transport have continued to rise. Increased use of electricity offers a promising decarbonization option, both to fuel electric vehicles and run power-to-x systems producing synthetic fuels. To understand the economic implications of increased coupling of the road transport and electricity sectors, an integrated multi-sectoral partial-equilibrium investment and dispatch model is developed for the European electricity and road transport sectors, linked by an energy transformation module to endogenously account for, e.g., increasing electricity consumption and flexibility provision from electric vehicles and power-to-x systems. The model is applied to analyze the effects of sector-specific CO2 reduction targets on the vehicle, electricity and power-to-x technology mix as well as trade flows of power-to-x fuels in European countries from 2020 to 2050. The results show that, by 2050, the fuel shares of electricity and power-to-x fuels in the European road transport sector reach 37{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} and 27{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}}, respectively, creating an additional electricity demand of 1200 TWh in Europe. To assess the added value of the integrated modeling approach, an additional analysis is performed in which all endogenous ties between sectors are removed. The results show that by decoupling the two sectors, the total system costs may be significantly overestimated and the production costs of power-to-x fuels may be inaccurately approximated, which may affect the merit order of decarbonization options.},

abstract = {A new Swiss TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) electricity model with an hourly representation of inter-temporal detail and a century-long model horizon has been developed to explore the TIMES framework's suitability as a long-term electricity dispatch model. To understand the incremental insights from this hourly model, it is compared to an aggregated model with only two diurnal timeslices like in most MARKAL/TIMES models. Two scenarios have been analysed with both models to answer the following questions: Are there differences in model solutions? What are the benefits of having a high number of timeslices? Are there any computational limitations? The primary objective of this paper is to understand the differences between the solutions of the two models, rather than Swiss policy implication or potential uncertainties in input parameters and assumptions. The analysis reveals that the hourly model offers powerful insights into the electricity generation schedule. Nevertheless, the TIMES framework cannot substitute for a dispatch model because some features cannot be represented; however, the long model time horizon and integrated system approaches of TIMES provide features not available in conventional dispatch models. The methodology of the model development and insights from the model comparison are described. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

@techreport{Kumar2012,
abstract = {Competition and increasing penetration of variable renewable generation are having a far-reaching impact on the operation of conventional fossil generation. For many utilities and plant operators, plant operations and maintenance (O{\&}M) expenditures are the one cost area that is currently rising at a rate faster than inflation. To stay competitive, utilities need to better understand the underlying nature of their plant O{\&}M costs, and take measures to use this knowledge to their advantage. A major root cause of this increase in O{\&}M cost for many fossil units is unit cycling. Power plant operators and utilities have been forced to cycle aging fossil units that were originally designed for base load operation. Cycling refers to the operation of electric generating units at varying load levels, including on/off, load following, and minimum load operation, in response to changes in system load requirements. Every time a power plant is turned off and on, the boiler, steam lines, turbine, and auxiliary components go through unavoidably large thermal and pressure stresses, which cause damage. This damage is made worse for high temperature components by the phenomenon we call creep-fatigue interaction. While cycling-related increases in failure rates may not be noted immediately, critical components will eventually start to fail. Shorter component life expectancies will result in higher plant equivalent forced outage rates (EFOR) and/or higher capital and maintenance costs to replace components at or near the end of their service lives. In addition, it may result in reduced overall plant life. How soon these detrimental effects will occur will depend on the amount of creep damage present and the specific types and frequency of the cycling. Several renewable integration studies, including those performed by NREL and WECC have recognized increased power plant cycling due to renewables. Additionally, most reports also list the need for more flexible generation in the generation mix to meet the challenge of ramping and providing reserve requirements. Intertek APTECH has provided generic lower bound cycling costs for conventional fossil generation in this report. The report also lists the typical cycling cost of the “flexible” power plants, as it is important to realize that while such plants are built for quick start and fast ramping capabilities, they are not inexpensive to cycle. There is still a cost to cycle such plants. Modern combined cycle plants also have constraints with HRSG reliability and have a cost to cycle. Finally, Intertek APTECH has provided an overview of systems and components commonly affected by cycling and mitigation strategies to minimize this cost.},

abstract = {Numerous functions, especially the Gompertz function, have been predetermined to analyze the growth in vehicle ownership. This study utilizes the data-driven symbolic regression to automatically find a generalized function, named as new equation by symbolic regression (NE-SR), for passenger car ownership in six representative countries including Japan, England, USA, Finland, Poland and Australia. Then the new proposed function is applied for forecasting the passenger car ownership in China up to the year 2060. The experimental results indicate that the NE-SR, as an extension of the Gompertz function, fits better than the classical Gompertz function for car ownership growth. In NE-SR function, three scenarios can be realized by the variation of parameter signs, which are represented by the patterns of Japan, USA and Australia, respectively. The predicted results based on the NE-SR also show that the Chinese car ownership still has a potential to increase after 2060 in the pattern of Japan and Australia, but grows until around 2057 in the pattern of USA. The results can be used to further predict the energy demand and carbon emissions of passenger cars, which can provide a basis for the policymaker to propose transportation and environmental strategies.},

abstract = {There is a growing consensus that moving to a low carbon future within the transport sector will require a substantial shift away from fossil fuels toward more sustainable means of transport. A particular emphasis has been given to battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), with many nations investing in improving their charging infrastructure and incentivising electric vehicle purchasing through offering grant schemes and tax relief to consumers. Despite these incentives, the uptake of BEVs and PHEVs has been low, while some countries, such as Ireland and Denmark, are in the process of removing the tax relief currently in place. This initial retraction has already been met with a fall in sales of BEVs and PHEVs, which is expected to continue decreasing as these incentives are further reduced. This study develops a socio-economic consumer choice model of the private transport sector based off national empirical data for Ireland and Denmark to analyse the long-term effects of these subsidy retractions, and to further analyse the policy measures and associated cost of moving toward a low carbon private transport sector.},

On the technical front, the feasibility of the transmission options considering supply quality constraints and the optimal sizing of reactive power compensation to allow maximum real power transfer capability in the subsea transmission cable have been considered. The economic viability of different transmission options are measured based on component costs and the costs associated with the transmission losses. A case study has been presented in the paper, which demonstrates the application of this techno-economic analysis framework on a range of MEC farm sizes and distances from the shore. The results characterise the performance of different transmission system options with respect to three key design parameters - distance to shore, array power and transmission voltage - and provide guidance for system design.},

abstract = {Interest in renewable energy in Ireland has increased continually over the past decade. This interest is due primarily to security of supply issues and the effects of climate change. Ireland imports over 90{\%} of its primary energy consumption, mostly in the form of fossil fuels. The exploitation of Ireland's vast indigenous renewable energy resources is required in order to reduce this over-dependence on fossil fuel imports to meet energy demand. Various targets have been set by the Irish government to incorporate renewable energy technologies into Ireland's energy market. As a result of these targets, the development in wind energy has increased substantially over the past decade; however this method of energy extraction is intermittent and unpredictable. Ireland has an excellent tidal current energy resource and the use of this resource will assist in the development of a sustainable energy future. Energy extraction using tidal current energy technologies offers a vast and predictable energy resource. This paper reviews the currently accepted tidal current energy resource assessment for Ireland. This assessment was compiled by Sustainable Energy Ireland in a report in 2004. The assessment employed a 2-dimensional numerical model of the tidal current velocities around Ireland, and from this numerical model the theoretical tidal current energy resource was identified. With the introduction of constraints and limitations, the technical, practical, accessible and viable tidal current energy resources were obtained. The paper discusses why the assessment needs updating including the effect on the assessment of the current stage of development of tidal current turbines and their deployment technology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we provide a practical how-to guide based on the collective experience of members of the Open Energy Modelling Initiative (Openmod). We discuss key steps to consider when opening code and data, including determining intellectual property ownership, choosing a licence and appropriate modelling languages, distributing code and data, and providing support and building communities. After illustrating these decisions with examples and lessons learned from the community, we conclude that even though individual researchers' choices are important, institutional changes are still also necessary for more openness and transparency in energy research.},

Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We find slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries. The simulation code and the hourly simulations for all European countries are available freely via an interactive web platform, www.renewables.ninja.},

abstract = {Energy policies are often related to the global effort in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increased use of renewable energies in electricity production. The impact of these policies is usually calculated by energy planning tools. However, the modeling methodologies most currently used are not adequate to simulate long-term scenarios while considering the hourly dynamics of supply and demand. This paper presents an extension of the TIMES energy planning tool for investment decisions in electricity production that considers seasonal, daily and hourly supply and demand dynamics. The inclusion of these dynamics enables the model to produce more accurate results in what concerns the impact of introducing energy efficiency policies and the increased use of renewable energies. The model was validated in S{\~{a}}o Miguel (Azores, Portugal) for the years 2006-2009, where a comparison with real data showed that the model can simulate the supply and demand dynamics. Further, the long-term analysis shows that the inclusion of these dynamics contributes to a better assessment of the renewable energy potential, suggests the postponement of investments in new generation capacity, and demonstrates that using fine time resolution modeling is very valuable for the design of effective policy measures under high renewable penetration energy systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To limit the computational cost, bottom-up long-term (LT) energy-system planning models typically have a stylized temporal representation and do not consider techno-economic operational constraints of power plants. Both these simplifications have been shown to have a significant impact on the results. However, increasing the level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail will result in an increased computational cost. In this regard, the first goal of this work is to quantify which of these simplifications has the highest impact on the results, and should therefore be prioritized for improving. To do so, the impact of both the low level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail are quantified for a varying penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). For a high penetration of IRES, the gains obtained by improving the temporal representation are shown to outweigh the gains obtained by incorporating detailed techno-economic operational constraints. Therefore, improving the temporal representation is suggested to be prioritized. The second goal of this paper is to identify opportunities for model improvements. Different approaches to improve the temporal representation are proposed. While the focus in the literature lies primarily on the impact of the temporal resolution, this work more fundamentally considers and assesses different approaches of dealing with the temporal dimension. Using a different approach of defining the time slices to explicitly account for IRES variability is found to lead to a higher accuracy than can be obtained by simply increasing the temporal resolution, while requiring a lower number of time slices. Moreover, a temporal representation based on selecting a set of representative days can achieve an even higher accuracy, albeit requiring a higher number of time slices. An additional advantage of using representative days is that chronology is retained such that the impact of short-term dynamic fluctuations of IRES can be accounted for.},

abstract = {Energy modelling can assist national decision makers in determining strategies that achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, three key challenges for the modelling community are emerging under this radical climate target that needs to be recognized and addressed. A first challenge is the need to represent new mitigation options not currently represented in many energy models. We emphasize here the under representation of end-use sector demand-side options due to the traditional supply side focus of many energy models, along with issues surrounding robustness in deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options. A second challenge concerns the types of models used. We highlight doubts about whether current models provide sufficient relevant insights on system feasibility, actor behaviour, and policy effectiveness. A third challenge concerns how models are applied for policy analyses. Priorities include the need for expanding scenario thinking to incorporate a wider range of uncertainty factors, providing insights on target setting, alignment with broader policy objectives, and improving engagement and transparency of approaches. There is a significant risk that without reconsidering energy modelling approaches, the role that the modelling community can play in providing effective decision support may be reduced. Such support is critical, as countries seek to develop new Nationally Determined Contributions and longer-term strategies over the next few years. Key policy insights Energy systems that reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions will be radically different to those of today, necessitating a modelling analysis re-think. On modelled options for mitigation, a range of demand-side measures are often absent resulting in a risk of over-reliance on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and leading to concerns over robustness of corresponding pathways. Regarding models for policy, there is significant scope for improvements, including the use of scenarios that help imagine the radical change that will be required, techniques for improving the robustness of emerging strategies, and better alignment with broader policy goals.},

abstract = {The feasibility of large-scale biological CO2 removal to achieve stringent climate targets remains unclear. Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) offers an alternative negative emissions technology (NET) option. Here we conduct the first inter-model comparison on the role of DACCS in 1.5 and 2 °C scenarios, under a variety of techno-economic assumptions. Deploying DACCS significantly reduces mitigation costs, and it complements rather than substitutes other NETs. The key factor limiting DACCS deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios' average DACCS scale-up rates of 1.5 GtCO2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300 EJ/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that DACCS can be deployed at scale, and finding it to be subsequently unavailable, leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8 °C. DACCS should therefore be developed and deployed alongside, rather than instead of, other mitigation options.},

The demand-side comprises sectoral sub-models, with a detailed bottom-up approach used for the transport and residential sectors and a top-down approach used for the industry and services sectors. The supply side uses the linear programming optimisation features of the Open Source Energy Modelling System applied to electricity generation to calculate the least-cost solution. This paper presents the first national level model developed within the Long Range Energy Alternatives Planning software to combine detailed end-use analysis on the demand side with a cost-minimising optimisation approach for modelling the electricity generation sector. Through three scenarios over the period 2009-2020, the model examines the aggregate impact on energy demand of a selection of current and proposed energy efficiency policies. In 2020, energy demand in the energy efficiency scenario is 8.6 {\%} lower than the reference scenario and 11.1 {\%} lower in the energy efficiency + scenario. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Both wind and solar have separately a potential electricity production which is equivalent to three times the EU's 2016 electricity demand, with wind onshore and solar requiring 16{\%} and 1.4{\%} of total land, respectively. For biomass, agriculture, forestry and waste sectors are considered. Their respective sustainable potentials are equivalent to a minimum 10{\%}, 1.5{\%} and 1{\%} of the total EU primary energy use.

However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50{\%} in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30{\%} in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2{\%}, with countries ranging from 19.5{\%} (Germany) to 32.4{\%} (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23{\%} more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3{\%}. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4{\%} and Germany's to 29.1{\%}.},

abstract = {Standfirst Energy modelling has a crucial underpinning role for policy making, but the modelling-policy interface currently faces several limitations. Therefore a reinvention of this energy modelling-policy interface is detailed to better provide timely, targeted, tested, transparent and iterated insights from such complex multidisciplinary tools. Energy models provide the integrating framework that assists energy policy and industrial energy decision makers. By applying data to a coherent theoretical structure and using computer modelling software, they provide essential quantitative insights into alternative energy system design under conditions of pervasive uncertainty. The underpinning policy role of energy modelling occurs through the most widely quoted international reviews 1 , through the statutory policy assessment processes in major economies 2 , and for energy balances and long term investment planning in less developed economies. 3 Importance of energy modelling in the policy evidence base There are a broad set of viewpoints on the overall role of modelling in the policy process. Social science commentators 4 classify at what stages in the policy process (advisory, discussion, participatory, mediation, strategic, analytical) modelling can contribute 5 . Other policy commentators focus on the experts themselves (including modellers), as well as on the importance of transparency and interdisciplinarity 6 , and on the high level of complexity in policy insights that decision makers require 7 . Energy modellers' self-examination of the policy role of their tools is more circumspect. Some reviews of the typology of models suggest better links between them are needed. 8 Only a relatively small set of ex-post studies 9 attempt to assess the accuracy of prior modelling exercises. Those studies that actually examine the energy policy-modelling interface acknowledge the weak links between provision of insights and policy-maker needs, focusing on the imperfect process of policy making 10 or the specific policy requirements (and limited analytical capacity) of developing countries. 11 Similar limitations in the successful engagement of models with policy makers are raised in related fields, notably water resources 12 and ecosystem management. 13 Looking beyond environmental issues, the modelling-policy reinvention improvements proposed here are consistent with recommendations in other policy fields such as public health.},

abstract = {Retrofitting is one of the most important policy measures for timely decarbonisation of the residential sector due to slow turnover of the housing stock. Ireland is an interesting case study given the high reliance on oil as a fuel, the dispersed pattern of residential housing and the relatively poor energy efficiency performance of the existing housing stock. Decarbonising residential space and water heating has proved challenging in the Irish context. These energy service demands are generally inflexible and resilient to reduction due to a range of considerations including external weather conditions, fuel price and the rebound effect. This paper examines and challenges the suitability of popular retrofit combinations as they apply to nine distinct building archetypes in Ireland's housing stock portfolio. An archetype simulation model is used to evaluate the potential for improved energy efficiency gains within the existing retrofit program. We introduce a new methodology that provides insights into sub-optimal retrofit choices. The five most common retrofit combinations are simulated for each of the nine archetypes. The results show that the alternative retrofit combination differs by archetype and that additional energy efficiency gains of up to 86{\%} can be achieved due to alternative retrofit choices. We believe there is room to improve building energy efficiency standards in Ireland through the implementation of a bespoke building retrofit grant scheme which delivers better informed retrofit choices and more effectively considers the pre-existing condition of a building as part of the initial application process. The implications of this analysis are explored and insights for policy are also provided.},

This article presents 3 data sources which are utilised in conjunction with a detailed energy system model of the residential sector to explore policy pathways for residential retrofitting. Data is collected from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The first SEAI dataset is compiled for Ireland in compliance with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) [2]. Data is collected using the Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure (DEAP) [3]. DEAP is used to produce energy performance certificates known as Building Energy Ratings (BER). A BER indicates a buildings energy performance across a 15-point energy efficiency scale, rated alphabetically from A1 to G, in units of kWh/m2 year. A BER is required for new buildings and the rent or sale of existing dwellings – therefore the database has consistently grown in size since its inception in 2006. The BER database contains 735,906 records of individual dwellings. The database includes detailed building fabric information across a range of different building types, year of construction, Main/Secondary space/water heating fuels, heating system efficiency, ventilation method and structure type (Insulated concrete form, Masonry, Timber or Steel Frame). The second SEAI dataset (PWBER) contains aggregated pre and post BER information for a sample of 112,007 dwellings retrofitted during the period 2010–2015; this database contains mean energy efficiency improvement (kWh/m2 year) for a range of retrofit combinations as they apply to nine distinct building archetypes. The third CSO dataset is compiled from census data, representing the frequency of building types by year of construction.},

abstract = {Reducing energy consumption and emissions from freight transport plays an important role in climate change mitigation. However, there remains a need for enhanced policymaking and research to explore a low carbon future of freight transport. This research establishes a freight transport model to simulate transport demand (tonne kilometre), energy consumption and emissions. The model incorporates macroeconomic factors, policy indicators, technological characteristics, detailed profiles of the vehicle stock and travel distances, and behavioural parameters with discrete based choices. This model is applied to the freight transport sector in Ireland with scenarios running out to 2050. The results show that overall freight transport demand increases substantially from 2015 to 2050. Economy-wide climate policies (i.e. carbon tax) and high fuel prices result in modest reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in freight transport, compared to a baseline. Sectoral measures, such as European CO2 emission performance standards, that aim to improve new vehicle fuel efficiency/emission rates can potentially lead to significant reductions, but such measures face a lag in greening the goods vehicle stock in the short/mid term, and uncertainties in policy compliance and technical barriers in the long run. Notably, in spite of few commercially mature vehicle technologies, adoption of biofuel and alternative freight vehicles are expected to bring additional reductions in future energy consumption and emissions. In all, for a transition to a low carbon future for freight transport, a comprehensive and dynamic policy agenda should be developed to promote low or zero emission vehicles, especially for heavy goods vehicles.},

abstract = {Data centres (DCs) are expected to satisfy the rising demand for internet services. Denmark alone is expected to host several large-scale DCs, whose demand for electricity in 2040 may reach 33{\%} of 2017 national electricity consumption. Understanding the operation and interactions of DCs with energy systems is key to understanding their impacts on installed capacities, costs and emissions. The present paper makes three contributions in this regard. First, we introduce a thermodynamic model that relates the power consumption of DCs to their production of excess heat (EH). Second, the results are scaled up to represent DCs in a national energy-system model for the analysis of different scenarios. Third, scenarios are generated and analysed to quantify the impact of DCs on the Danish energy system until 2050. The results show that DCs might have significant impacts on Denmark's power and district heating (DH) sectors. First, the power demand from DCs translates into an additional 3–6 GW of offshore wind capacity. Second, EH from DCs is beneficial to the whole energy system, the entire quantity of EH being utilized in four out of five scenarios. EH recovery from DCs is economically beneficial, providing from 4{\%} to 27{\%} of Denmark's DH after 2040.},
